## How did we get here?

Towards the end of July, 2022, when Copilot was ending its beta period, and moving on to being a paid service, I put up a quick poll/question on Dev.to titled [Continue using GitHub Copilot?](https://dev.to/seancassiere/continue-using-github-copilot-1hnp).

I wanted to see what the community thought about the service, and whether they would continue using it or not.

Little did I know that this would be post would keep me busy for the entire day, with responding to comments being left, and even getting featured on a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/1539675337000423428) by Dev.to Community.

## What did people think?

The responses I got were mixed, with some people saying that they would continue using it, and others saying that they would not. It mostly centered around the fact that Copilot was a paid service, and that it was not worth the money.

Another important observation was that people's experience with Copilot varied based on the language they were using, type of project they were working on, and how early they were in their programming journey.

## My takeaways from the responses

I think that the responses I got were very interesting, and I learned a lot from them. Here are some of my takeaways:

- Copilot was not worth the money for people working on side-projects (outside of work).
- Those with a GitHub student accounts, planned to conitnue using it since it was free.
- A few people said that they'd speak to their company about getting a license for Copilot.

## What do I think?

I already have a GitHub student account and using Copilot on the daily for my assignments and side projects.

I can't tell you what the future will hold, and will I be able to afford the hefty **$10 a month** price tag, but for now, I am going to continue using it.
